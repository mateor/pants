README Files and Markdown
#########################

You can write program documentation in the popular Markdown format; Pants eases
publishing your docs to places where your users can read it. E.g., that
``README.md`` file in your source code is handy for editing; but you might
want to generate a web page from that so folks can decide whether they want
to look at your source code.

Markdown to HTML
****************

Pants uses the Python ``Markdown`` module; thus, in addition to
the usual Gruber ``Markdown`` syntax, there are
`other features <http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/>`_
Pants uses Python Markdown's ``codehilite``, ``extra``, ``tables``,
and ``toc`` extensions.

To tell Pants about your Markdown file, use a
:ref:`page <bdict_page>` target in a ``BUILD`` file
as in this excerpt from
`src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/main/BUILD
<https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/main/BUILD>`_:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/main/BUILD
   :start-after: README page

To render the page as HTML, use the :ref:`markdown goal <gref_phase_markdown>`.
For example, to
view ``src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/main/README.md`` as HTML in
your browser, ::

    ./pants goal markdown --markdown-open src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/main:readme

Link to Another ``page``
************************

One ``page`` can link to another. Regular Markdown-link syntax
works for regular links; but if you use ``page``\s to generate
both ``.html`` files and wiki pages, it's not clear what to link to:
the ``.html`` file or the wiki address.
You can use a Pants-specific syntax to make links that work with
generated HTML or wiki pages.

To set up a page ``source.md`` that contains a link to ``dest.md``, you
make a ``dependencies`` relation and use the special ``pants(...)`` syntax
in the markdown.

In the ``BUILD`` file::

        page(name='source',
          source='source.md',
          dependencies=[':dest'], # enables linking
          provides=[...publishing info...],
        )

        page(name='dest',
          source='dest.md',
          provides=[...publishing info...],
        )

To set up the links in ``source.md`` that point to ``dest.md`` or
an anchor therein::

        For more information about this fascinating topic,
        please see [[Destinations|pants('path/to:dest')]],
        especially the
        [[Addendum section|pants('path/to:dest')#addendum]],

Pants replaces the ``pants('path/to:dest')`` with the appropriate link.


Publishing
**********

You can tell Pants to publish a page.
So far, there's only one way to publish: as a page in an Atlassian
Confluence wiki.
(You can add other doc-publish backends to Pants; :doc:`send us a patch<dev>`!)

To specify the "address" to which to publish a page, give it a ``provides``
parameter.

Once you've done this, you can publish the page by invoking the goal
:ref:`set up in your workspace <page_setup_confluence>`.
For example, if the goal was set up with the name "confluence", you invoke ::

    ./pants goal confluence src/java/com/pants/examples/hello/main:readme

.. so far, we only support confluence; if that changes, this would be
   a good place for a section header: the stuff that follows is
   confluence-specific

To specify that a page should be published to a Confluence wiki page, set its
``provides`` like so::

    page(...
      provides=[
        wiki_artifact(wiki=pants('BUILD:confluence'),
          space='ENG',
          title='Pants Hello World Example',
          parent='Examples',
        )
      ],)

.. _page_setup_confluence:

**Setting up your workspace for Confluence publish**

That :ref:`wiki <bdict_wiki>` specifies some information about your wiki server.
So far, the only kind of thing you can publish to is a Confluence wiki.
You want to specify its target. Do this in one of the ``BUILD`` files
that's always processed (probably a top-directory ``BUILD`` file).
The target probably looks something like::

    import urllib

    def confluence_url_builder(page, config):
      return config['title'], 'https://wiki.archie.org/display/%s%s' % (
        config['space'],
        urllib.quote_plus(config['title']))

    # Use this wiki target's address for the wiki= param in your wiki_artifacts
    confluence = wiki(name="confluence",
                      url_builder=confluence_url_builder)

You need to install a goal to enable publishing a doc to confluence.
It might look like::

    class OurConfluence(ConfluencePublish):
      def wiki(self):
        return confluence # wiki target defined above
      def api(self):
        return 'confluence2' # Older confluence installations use older API

    goal(
      name='confluence',
      action=OurConfluence,
      dependencies=['markdown']
    ).install().with_description('Publish one or more confluence pages.')
